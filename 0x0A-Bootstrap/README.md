# 0x0A-Bootstrap

### Welcome!

During this project I have learned Bootstrap and its benefits, Bootstrap is a free and open source CSS framework oriented to responsive and mobile-first front-end web development. It contains **CSS** and **JavaScript** design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.



*For this project, you will use Bootstrap 4.4 and only the CSS styling part.*
